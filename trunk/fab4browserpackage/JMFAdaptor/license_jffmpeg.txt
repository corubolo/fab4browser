GPL Licensing

Classes under the GPL license implement the GPLLicense interface, and are clearly marked in the source code. The following codecs are licensed under the GPL license:

    * AC3 audio
    * VOB demultiplexer
    * The class net.sourceforge.jffmpeg.GPLLicense

The GPL classes may be separated from the rest of JFFMPEG by simply removing all classes that implement the GPLLicense interface.
LGPL Licensing

The majority of JFFMPEG is under an LGPL license. This include the following:

    * the Codec management framework
    * the Native codecs
    * parts of ffmpeg (native library)

The LGPL code may be shipped with GPL code.
BSD-Style License

The Ogg Vorbis demultiplexer and codec is a separate codebase for licensing purposes. See the Ogg Vorbis COPYING file for details. The Ogg Vorbis code may be shipped separately under its BSD style license. Similarly the rest of JFFMPEG can be shipped separately under the appropriate license terms.

Ogg Vorbis and the rest of JFFMPEG cannot be shipped under a single license, they are two different codebases licensed under two different licenses.

Note that this is a legal, not technical issue. If in doubt consult a lawyer.
