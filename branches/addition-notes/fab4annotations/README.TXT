Fab4 annotations module
-----------------------


This module includes support for distributed annotations. 

Currently, the support is limited to a local archive, until the server side component is updated.
Fab4 allows multiple modules to perform annotation serialisation and submission, but this component is still under development. 
This module is extended by the fab4rdfannotations module, that support remote annotations.
