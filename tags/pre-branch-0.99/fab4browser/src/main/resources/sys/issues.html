<h2>Known limitations and issues in Fab4 0.20 beta:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>There can be some display corruption&nbsp;zooming and
	resising&nbsp;PDF documents. &nbsp;As a temporary solution, reloading
	the document usually solves the problem.</li>

<h2>Planned improvements:</h2>


<ul>
	<li>Support for timed media (Theora, OGG, mp3)</li>
	<li>Annotations on timed media</li>
	<li>Add area annotation for images (square, ellipse...)</li>
	<li>Allow file attachment and image annotations.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Some of the recent changes:</h2>

<ul>

	<li>FIXED a regression: now PDF can again open directly to a
	specific page, see for example:
	http://www.pdf-tools.com/public/downloads/whitepapers/whitepaper-pdfprimer.pdf#page=4</li>
	<li>New terminology and uniform naming (public private, save or
	copy) hopefully more clear</li>

	<li>Linguistic tools, improvements in markings and export to XML
	with inline markings</li>
	<li>it's possible to copy notes between public and private (that
	is central server to local private database)</li>
	<li>private annotaions</li>

	<li>Interface to connect to generic annotation servers</li>

	<li>Various fixes in the UI</li>

	<li>FIXED: Java WebStart will not work on Java 1.6</li>

	<li>FIXED: PDF files seem to break on Java 1.6 (issue with Java
	1.6.0, updating to 1.6.01 (java6 update 1) solves the problem).</li>
