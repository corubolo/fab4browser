<html><body>
A collection of general-use spans:
hyperlink, highlight, font, color.

Spans control appearance and behavior over an arbitrary range of 
leaves (often text).

<p>Standard span function can be controlled 
by creating a {@link multivalent.Span} and setting display properties.
Spans in this package, such as {@link multivalent.std.span.HyperlinkSpan}, 
add behavior or have special appearance.
