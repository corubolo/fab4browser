I seem to fall into the same bad company every time.

<p> There are people whose ideas attract and motivate me.  These
people usually produce ideas and systems that attract and motivate
me.  Sometimes I meet the idea or system before the person, sometimes
the other way 'round.  I couldn't even always identify the humans
involved with the ideas and systems.  But I know them.

<p> They're my clan, my village, my clique.

<p> But what the hell are they?  More precisely, what distinguishes
them from other people and things?  (And yes, I mean to include
"things" on the list, as I will explain.)

<p> I think I have figured it out.  I think we're all addicts to
elegance.

<p> Over time I have come to see elegance as an end in itself, not
only because I prefer to be surrounded by nice things.  Elegance
seems to be a marker of real, inherent value.  Lots of things work.
Only a few things are elegant.  Elegant things change how you do
things, and sometimes how you think.  They make difficult things
accessible, or at best, they make them invisible.

<p> This is a premise that I believe, but I do not intend to make
a strong case for it here.  I will leave that for the future.  I'm
simply going to try to lay out the idea, primarily so that those
of us in the same clan can find each other.  In fact, I could almost
stop now.  Most of the elegance-based community already know who
they are from what I've already written, whether they've called it
that or not.

<p> Aesthetic qualities are notoriously difficult to define;
philosophers have struggled with it for millennia with no real
resolution.  So I'm not going to try.  I'm going to play an example
game:

<dl>

<dt> Adobe Photoshop: elegant.

<dd> It's UI is intuitive, it can be expanded by third parties to
add value, and what it does is powerful -- it makes new visuals
possible.  The mathematics that underly it are very complicated,
but it doesn't matter -- what matters is that you have tools to
smudge, smear, sketch, warp, and layer images.  You can put anyone
who has curiosity and sense of play in front of Photoshop and after
a while they'll basically get it, and be creating things that amuse
them and, not long after, will amuse others.

<dt> Adobe Illustrator: inelegant.

<dd> It can do a lot of things, but its approach is unintuitive and
the UI doesn't help.  I think it would be a rare person who could
sit in front of Illustrator and figure out how to do things.

<dt> Python: elegant.

<dd> Pseudo code that works.

<dt> C++: inelegant.

<dd> C++ could be the poster child of inelegance.  Everything can
be done, but the language is rife with inconsistencies in user
model, syntax, approach, style.  You can know most of what you need
to about the inelegance of C++ by noting that the preferred syntax
for declaring (say) a pointer to an <tt>int</tt> is
"<tt>int*&nbsp;ip</tt>", which implies that "<tt>int*&nbsp;ip,jp</tt>"
would declare two <tt>int</tt> pointers.  But it wouldn't because
the <tt>*</tt> is really (that is, in the compiler and grammar)
attached to the <tt>ip</tt>, not the <tt>int</tt>.  The standard
coding style promulgated the by creator of the language <em>lies
about the syntax.</em>  What kind of elegance can you expect from
someone with that kind of design approach?

<dt> Perl: uh, well, hm.

<dd> Perl is an odd mixture.  Perl has the great feature of elegance
that it's easy to do many things in a direct way.  But have you
heard the saying that software is often first Baroque, then Roccoco,
then Rubble?  So much stuff has been piled on Perl that it is
starting to pass well through the Roccoco stage, creeping towards
rubble.  "Not just one way to do things" is a good principle in
your pocket, but it's not a design philosophy that works because
it doesn't tell you when <em>not</em> to add something.

</dl>

<p> <em>Not</em> adding things is the hallmark of elegance.  Almost
everyone clan member I know has the following statement from Antoine
de Saint-Exupery in their soul, and often on their wall:

<blockquote> <i>Perfection is reached, not when there is no longer
anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take
away.</i> </blockquote>

<p> You'll notice that this idea has <em>never</em> infected the
Microsoft Word team.

<p> There are people who are drawn to elegance.  Some people know
that elegance is not a frill, not a patina.  It's not something
that you add to something.  It's what something <em>is.</em>  And
it really, really matters.  Lack of elegance makes something harder
to use, harder to understand, harder to express with, harder to get
right.  The number of bugs possible in an inelegant system can be
many times larger than in an elegant one that doesn't give you as
much rope, but only the right rope.
