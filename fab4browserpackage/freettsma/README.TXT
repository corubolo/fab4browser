Fab4 FreeTTS behaviour
-----------------------

This behaviour allows using the FreeTTs Text to Speech engine (avaiable at http://freetts.sourceforge.net/)
to have a read out of the contents of the document. 

----

Usage:

The output Jar and its dependencies need to be included first in the classpath (copied to the Fab4 library folder).
The lens can be started from the lenses menu, voice read.
