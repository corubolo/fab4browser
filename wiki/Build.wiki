= Build instructions =

It should be simple to build the fab4browserpackage using Maven2. 

  * Download and install Maven from http://maven.apache.org/
  * Open a shell, and increase the Maven memory for compiling, as the default is not sufficient: export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m
  * change directory to the fab4browserpackage folder, 'cd folder' 
  * run mvn install

The final output for the project consists in two files:

1) ./fab4assembly/target/fab4-browser-version.zip
The zip file includes Fab4 and all the dependencies. To run the program, simply unzip the file and execure
java -jar fab4-start.jar

2) ./fab4webstart/target/fab4webstart.war
Java web archive, containing all the above and a dynamic servlet for opening documents directly into Fab4 (using Webstart). 
This can be deployed to a standard servlet container.
