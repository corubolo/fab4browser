#summary contains the build instructions.

= Build instructions =

It should be simple to build the fab4browserpackage using Maven2. 

  * Download and install Maven from http://maven.apache.org/
  * Open a shell, and increase the Maven memory for compiling, as the default is not sufficient: export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m
  * change directory to the fab4browserpackage folder, 'cd folder' 
  * run mvn install

The final output for the project consists in two files:

1) ./fab4assembly/target/fab4-browser-version.zip
The zip file includes Fab4 and all the dependencies. To run the program, simply unzip the file and execure
java -jar fab4-start.jar

2) ./fab4webstart/target/fab4webstart.war
Java web archive, containing all the above and a dynamic servlet for opening documents directly into Fab4 (using Webstart). 
This can be deployed to a standard servlet container.

===PPT media adaptor===

This build is based on a set of different components, that need to be compiled and installed (mvn install) in the right order:
  * First of all, the LGPL Pict image decoder;
  * Secondly, the ApachePOIAdditions
  * The modified version of Apache POI (based on Version 3.6 currently) 
  * Last, the pptmediaadaptor (integration into Multivalent framework) has to be compiled.
Once all the components are installed, it is possible to add the PPTMediaAdaptor dependency to the main project Fab4assembly, to have it included into the fab4 zip ad webstart targets.
