Generally useful utility classes that should be part of Java, but aren't.

<p>Some classes rely on parts of <code>Multivalent.jar</code>, 
which should be in the CLASSPATH.
These classes operate on a document tree or require HTML parsing.
Most classes can be used without <code>Multivalent.jar</code>.
